    "# PyPro: challenge 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "### This challenge is due on Sunday 29th September 2024 at 8pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "`These exercises provide a wide range of challenges that test your understanding of Python's core concepts, such as control structures, data types, string manipulations, list comprehensions, and higher-order functions.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a function `find_max()` that accepts two numeric inputs and returns the greater value. Avoid using the built-in `max()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop a function `find_max_of_three()` to find the maximum among three given numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a function to manually calculate the length of a given list or string without using `len()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement a function that checks if a given character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a function `encode()` that converts a string into \"rövarspråket\" ([robber's language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6varspr%C3%A5ket)) by doubling consonants and placing \"o\" in between, e.g., \"hello\" -> \"hohelollolo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create `sum_elements()` and `product_elements()` functions to sum and multiply all elements in a list, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Define a function `reverse_string()` to reverse the characters in a given string.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Implement `check_palindrome()` to verify if a string reads the same forwards and backwards, i.e. is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Develop a function `check_membership()` to determine if a value exists within a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Write `check_overlap()` to identify if two lists share any elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Implement `repeat_char()` that generates a string with a specified character repeated `n` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Create a function `print_histogram()` that takes a list of integers and prints a corresponding histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Write `find_max_in_list()` to identify the largest number in a list of arbitrary length.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Create a program that maps each word in a list to its length.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Implement `longest_word()` to find the longest word in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Develop `filter_words()` to return words longer than a specified length from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Enhance the palindrome recognizer to handle phrases, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Implement a function that checks if a given sentence is a [pangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram).\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Write a function that generates verses for the \"99 Bottles of Beer\" song.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Create a translation function using a small dictionary to translate English words into French/.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Develop `char_frequency()` to build a dictionary of character frequencies in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Implement a [Caesar cipher encoder/decoder using a shift of 13 (ROT-13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Create `fix_spaces()` to correct multiple spaces and missing spaces after periods in a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Write `convert_to_third_person()` to transform verbs into their third person singular form.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Higher-Order Functions and List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "26. Use `reduce()` to write `max_in_list()` that returns the largest number in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. Write a program that maps words to their lengths using a for-loop, `map()`, and list comprehensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "28. Implement `find_longest_word()` using only higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. Use `filter()` to write `filter_long_words()` that filters words longer than `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. Create `translate_with_map()` to translate English words to French using `map()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "31. Re-implement the higher-order functions `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "41. Create a [Lingo game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(American_game_show)) where players guess a hidden word, receiving clues about correct and misplaced characters.\n",
